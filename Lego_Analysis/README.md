# Exploratory Analysis on the History & Evolution of LEGO Mini-figures

## Background
As a toddler, LEGO toys were the foundation for everything. The goal for each day was to come up with new creative ways to create some otherworldly figure and 20 years later, that same love for LEGO toys has led me into taking a deep dive into the history, evolution and the essence behind LEGO and LEGO Group.

The LEGO Group is a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark. The company is still owned by the Kirk Kristiansen family who founded it in 1932.

I recently stumbled on this dataset containing LEGO sets released from 1970 to 2022, including details on each set’s theme, categories, pieces, recommended age, retail price, and image.

## Objective
This project aimed at exploring the history and evolution of LEGO mini-figures, tracing their growth and development over the years from 1970 to 2022. The analysis centred on identifying patterns in the presence of mini-figures and themes in LEGO sets, modifications to design, and the influence of customer preferences and the market on LEGO’s mini-figure strategy.

### For this project various insights were generated regarding the customer and market influence on LEGO mini-figures but the main recommended analysis involved:

How many LEGO sets have been released since 1970? 

Is there a noticeable trend?

Is there a relationship between the price of a set and its number of pieces?

Which has been the most popular theme in each decade?

Are LEGO mini-figures most closely tied to licensed sets?

## The Process
### Initial Analysis & Data Exploration with Excel
Based on the comprehensive dataset of LEGO sets provided, initial Analysis was done using Microsoft Excel to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The main aim of using Excel was to find early trends and patterns in the data, this phase entailed:

Filtering and sorting all the columns in the data set,
Data cleaning to eliminate duplicates and remove discrepancies,
Carrying out basic statistical analysis.
This phase also involved paying close attention to the frequency and attributes of mini-figures in the sets.

## Advanced Visualization with Power BI
Microsoft Power BI was the visualization tool used for this project. The main purpose of Power BI was to create an interactive visualization to easily communicate the insights and overview to stakeholders. Power BI was used to import the Excel dataset that had been cleaned and organized.

After importing the tables, transformation of the data was carried out using power query to promote headers, and change date type.

With the aid of Power BI, the following were achieved:

Advanced visualizations were made to show the development of LEGO mini-figures. Among these were thematic comparisons, time-series studies demonstrating the increase in pieces and mini-figures, and the correlation between LEGO sets and mini-figure inclusion.
Interactive elements such as “Drill Through”, “Slicer”, and “Tooltips” were incorporated to allow dynamic exploration of the data, such as filtering by decade.
To present the insights, multiple dashboards were created.

## Analysis & Insight
After conducting an exploratory analysis of the LEGO dataset using Excel and visualizing it with Microsoft Power BI, several key insights were uncovered:

### Growth Trends: 
With LEGO’s strategy change toward licensed themes and character-driven sets, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of mini-figures each set, particularly after 2000. Number of usages of LEGO sets was rapidly increased year on year. Year 2022 has the highest total LEGO sets 967 followed by 2021, 2017, and 2020. Year 1974 has lowest total LEGO sets 40 followed by 1972, 1975 and 1970.

### Theme and Pieces Evolution: 
The introduction of new themes, particularly licensed franchises, was closely associated with changes in the design and diversity of mini-figures. Themes such as LEGOLAND and Town dominated the earlier decades, while Gear-themed sets gained prominence in the 2000s and beyond. Understanding the popularity of themes in different decades can inform product development decisions, marketing campaigns, and licensing agreements to capitalize on nostalgic appeal and emerging trends.

## Market Influence: 
As evidenced by the launch of the Collectible Mini-figures series and the growing diversity of mini-figure representation, consumer preferences and the collector’s market seem to have a big say in LEGO’s mini-figure strategy.

## Conclusion
The study effectively documented the historical development of LEGO mini-figures, highlighting the ways in which changing consumer tastes, market approaches, and societal factors have influenced the mini-figures history.

Combining qualitative research with quantitative data analysis allowed for a thorough understanding of the mini-figures evolution from general, simplistic figures to the varied, character-rich  components that are essential to the LEGO experience.
