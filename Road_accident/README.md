# ROAD ACCIDENT
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repository focuses on analyzing road accident data using PowerBI. The project involves a comprehensive approach, including data cleaning, data processing, data modeling, and connecting PowerBI with a CSV file.

In this project, the data file contain records of accidents on the road and road user statistics. The road transportation system faces both predictable and unforeseen accidents which we will be analyzing  by determining the weather conditions, day and location. This project investigates the type of vehicles and what events could most likely trigger them.

By looking at the demographics of traﬃc accident victims for each country, we find that there is a lot of variation between these countries. Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for an action plan.

The goal of the project is developing a Powerbi Dashboard to create insights about road accident data in the United Kingdom.

Dashboard can be filtered by year and severity of accident, and it can help in making value comparisons between the previous and current years. Also this dashboard displays the number of casualties by vehicle or road category.The severity of fatalities varies depending on the weather conditions and road surface.
