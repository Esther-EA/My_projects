# COVID-19 VACCINATION
## INRODUCTION
In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, marked the beginning of the global Covid-19 pandemic caused by the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Widespread closures of educational institutions and public areas occurred globally in 2020 and 2021. COVID-19 vaccines were approved and distributed from December 2020 onwards, accompanied by preventive measures like social distancing, mask-wearing, and quarantining.

As of December 11, 2022, the pandemic had resulted in over 649 million cases and 6.65 million confirmed deaths, causing severe social and economic disruptions worldwide. Racial and geographic discrimination issues emerged, prompting a delicate balance between public health imperatives and individual rights. While the WHO still considers the pandemic ongoing as of October 2022, some countries are transitioning to viewing SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic virus. The project analyzed COVID-19 public data until December 31, 2022, using a dataset maintained by Our World in Data. The analysis aimed to provide insights into the trajectory and impact of the pandemic based on available raw data and how vacinations helped the recovery process of the world.


## PROJECT OVERVIEW 
In this project we will be analysing the influence and use of the COVID-19 vaccination to curb the widespread of the disease. we we establish the dates in which the vaccines were administered, the countries with the highest vaccine administration, the significance and outcome of the vaccination in each country.
we will be using Tableau and excel to conduct this analysis to acertain reliable analysis on this project.
